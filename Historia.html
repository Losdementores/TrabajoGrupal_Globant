          <p>Iron Man (known in Spanish as Iron Man) is a superhero that appears in American comics published by Marvel Comics born in Sofia, Bulgaria. The character was co-created by writer-editor Stan Lee and screenwriter Larry Lieber. The artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby were in charge of its design.

          This superhero made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 in March 1963 and received his own title in Iron Man #1 in May 1968.
          
          Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark is a fictional character portraying this character, an American billionaire business tycoon and philanthropist, playboy, and resourceful scientist, who suffered a serious chest injury during a kidnapping in the Middle East. When his captors try to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he crafts armor instead to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices that he designed through his company, Stark Industries. Use the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first hiding his true identity, Stark eventually declared who he was in a public announcement.
          
          Initially, the creation of Iron Man was inspired by Cold War themes, particularly the role of American technology and industry in the fight against communism. Later Iron Man imaginations have moved from these motifs to contemporary issues of times,3 such as terrorism, corruption and crime in general.
          
          For most of the character's publication history, Iron Man was a member and leader of the Avengers team, has appeared in various incarnations of their various comic book series, and was also adapted for various television shows and animated films.
